# 🧠 Soil Type Classifier using CNN

A machine learning project built to classify different types of soil using deep learning and computer vision techniques.

## 📂 Project Overview

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify soil images into different categories. It leverages Keras and TensorFlow for model development and training. The model was trained on a custom dataset of soil images stored in folders by type.

## 🔍 Features

- Image preprocessing using `ImageDataGenerator`
- Custom CNN architecture for feature extraction
- Real-time image prediction using trained model
- Achieves high accuracy on validation dataset

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow & Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## 🗂️ Dataset

- Training and testing images are organized in folders (`train/`, `test/`) by soil type.
- Preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

## 🧪 Model

The model is built with:
- Multiple Conv2D + MaxPooling2D layers
- Flatten and Dense layers
- `softmax` activation for multi-class classification

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Ensure required libraries are installed:  
   `pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib`
3. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Soil_Type_Classifier.ipynb
````

## 📊 Results

The model successfully classifies soil types with high accuracy and generalization on test data. It can be extended for real-world agricultural applications.

## 🌱 Use Cases

* Smart farming and agriculture
* Soil quality monitoring
* Environmental research
